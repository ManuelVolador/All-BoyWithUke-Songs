# Sick of U (feat. Oliver Tree)

Things are better off this way
Wish you never ever knew my name
Wish I never said "Hi" 'cause you got really cute eyes
I don't wanna cut ties hust to kiss your face
So thing are better off this way
Get out of my brain, I'm out my lane
I'm not playing this game 
I know I'll be fine, I can tell you tell lies 
And I hope you don't mind that I turn away

'Cause you'll just do it again
And you'll fuck all my friends, and you'll just fuck with my head 
And I'm so done with the mess you left embedded in lead
I want you out of my life, I'm sick of all of your lies 
I'm sick of all the things you use to do with my mind 

'Cause you'll just do it again
You just love to pretend to be innocent
Fuck you I think you're insignificant
Don't you look at my eyes, go and say you goodbyes 
You fuck up bad now you're wasting my time

You treated me wrong, I'm so glad you're gone
Why can't I move on?
You filled me with hate, you made my heart break
Still, I can't escape
I tried and I tried but I'm left dead inside
And you're killing me slowly without even knowing

Well, love has a cost and both of us lost
It went on way too long
Like, it never would end 'til the day that we're dead
And both of us are gone
I tried and I tried, we both had lost our minds
I felt so sick to my stomach but I know that you love it
'Cause you'll just do it again
And you'll fuck all my friends, and you'll just fuck with my head

And I'm so done with the mess you left embedded in lead
I want you out of my life, I'm sick of all of your lies
I'm sick of all the little things you used to do with my mind
'Cause you'll just do it again
You just love to pretend to be innocent
Fuck you, I think you're insignificant
Don't you look at my eyes, go and say your goodbyes
You fucked up bad now you're wasting my time

You made my heart break and my stomach ache
And in my mouth you left a terrible taste
Why do I love you still?
I got physically ill from every shitty thing you made me feel

Yup, and it's so cold, but what do I know?
I got somebody in my psyche hitting high notes
I got nobody on my side, I'm a psycho
Might go at night, I'm a boy with a knife, woah
Thank God every night for my nice home
Even if I wish I'd die, I'm alright bro
Thoughts stay inside my mind with a light code
Life goes on and on

'Cause you'll just do it again
And you'll fuck all my friends, and you'll just fuck with my head
And I'm so done with the mess you left embedded in lead
I want you out of my life, I'm sick of all of your lies
I'm sick of all the little things you used to do with my mind

'Cause you'll just do it again
You just love to pretend to be innocent
Fuck you, I think you're insignificant
Don't you look at my eyes, go and say your goodbyes
You fucked up bad now you're wasting my time




# She Said No

Stood together outside, I don't even know what
Was going through my mind, now I think it was love
I never knew I could find someone who I thought was dumb
But made my heart go, "Ba-da-dum, ba-da-dum"

And I was so scared for my life
But I said that I would rather try
And I'm pretty sure I'm out of time
Ha, ha, ha

And I throw my meds straight into the mud
'Cause it doesn't seem to help me when I'm falling in love
And my stomach hurts, but I don't mention the blood
I think I might need a doctor for the mess that I've become

Oh, I found it hard to breathe
It's getting dark out, don't you think?
Tell me, or is it just me?

Then she took my coat 'cause it was cold
And we took pictures with her phone
She left her Polaroid at home
I texted all my friends, I wrote
That I was falling for this girl
Her eyes were glowing, hazel pearls
I told her that she was my world
And she said, yeah, she said no

Yeah, she said no
Yeah, she said no
Yeah, she said no
Yeah, she said...

You probably don't give a - who I am
I don't blame you, I hate me too, but I can't
Do a lot to change it or the thoughts in my head
I am faceless, I'm nameless, I'm better off dead

That's too far, I'm so sorry, please excuse my mess
I'm so stupid, so worthless, I won't do it again
That I promise you, I'm just a boy with a pen
And a ukulele, is it not evident?

That I'm broken, I'm frozen, I'm stuck in my bed
I was hoping you'd open me up, but instead
My emotions took over my mind and I said
That I hate you, I hate that I wish you were dead

Then she took my coat 'cause it was cold
And we took pictures with her phone
She left her Polaroid at home
I texted all my friends, I wrote
That I was falling for this girl
Her eyes were glowing, hazel pearls
I told her that she was my world
And she said, yeah, she said...

Yeah, she said no
Yeah, she said no
Yeah, she said no
Yeah, she said no...





# Far Away

There's a hundred miles from you and I
And so many signs to forget you
And though I might be wrong
And though I write shit songs
I know it won't be long 'til I see you

Sorry but I just can't stop liking you
I hope these other guys won't see you
Oh, so pretty like I do
Please don't break my heart
It's hard enough to heal arteries without glue
I'll see it through if you're down to
I'll see you soon 'cause I miss you

I might go too high though, I'm typing all these typos
'Cause you're the sight I see when I'm falling off of my tightrope
And you're the life that flashes through my eyes when I will die
So I apologize, it's kinda hard for me to lose what I know
And I won't go too low, but you're as far as Pluto
A hundred sixty-three thousand six hundred yards from my home
And I hope that you don't get bored of me or my clothes
I'm kinda broke but making dough from all the songs that I wrote

Sorry but I just can't stop liking you
I hope these other guys won't see you
Oh, so pretty like I do
Please don't break my heart
It's hard enough to heal arteries without glue
I'll see it through if you're down to
I'll see you soon 'cause I miss you

I know I might seem childish writing all of these songs
I've wrote hundreds 'bout our love and staying strong
Though it won't be too long righting all of my wrongs
Know I'm on my way if you think something's off

Sorry but I just can't stop liking you (da-da-da-da-da-da)
I hope these other guys won't see you
Oh, so pretty like I do
Please don't break my heart
It's hard enough to heal arteries without glue (da-da-da-da-da-da)
I'll see it through if you're down to (da-da, da-da-da-da)
I'll see you soon 'cause I miss you (da, da, da-da-da)

Ba-da-da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da-da-da
Da-da, da-da-da-da
Da, da, da-da-da
Ba-da-da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da-da-da
Da-da, da-da-da-da
Da, da, da-da-da...




# Understand

Girl, I hope you understand I
Wanted to hold your hand, but I can't
Wanted to be your man back then
And you knew I fell for you, but you
Just broke my heart in two
I was sad, mad, and broken on my bed
Hoping I get rid of all the voices in my head

I was opening a packet of an undeveloped med
When I was met with a prescription of a bullet made of lead
And when I woke up in an hour in a pool of my own sweat
I said, "I swear to God I'll never even try to sleep again"
So instead I took my pen and started writing evidence
And when I started making sense, I found that I had reached the end
Oh, I'm upset, I have no friends, you wanna bet, you're just pretend?
You're just a pet confined within the lines of writing, you're not shit

I thought I stopped my psychopathic ways, I swear I did
I said I talked to people 'bout the problematic life I lived
They were my neighbors; razor blades and different flavored pills I hid
Therefore, I'm at surely my last straw
I'm so gassed, stuck in the past, I said that

Girl, I hope you understand I
Wanted to hold your hand, but I can't
Wanted to be your man back then
And so far I never held you with my arms
So it's hard to be the one you aren't with
Instead, filled with anxiety
Always was a part of me, guess I'm not cut out to be

Somebody 'cause it's not me, I'm not used to all the talking
Was an introvert that had converted feelings into writing
Used to cope with all my problems using notes and lots of rhyming
Used to hope for better days whenever nights would have me crying
I'm not lying when I say that I would rather die than go back
To the times that I would try and be the guy the people know as
Always fighting with the demons hiding far behind my eyelids
On an island full of violence, in my head I had two pilots

Oh, the sun don't shine, the skies turn gray
I feel it coursing through my veins
I said before I'm not okay
But you don't listen anyway
You know I tried, you turned away
Straight out lied right to my face
You fuck my life, ruined my day
But you don't know, so I'll say

Nothing can fill this silence
No one can love like I did (you don't know, so I'll say)
Nobody cares, you lied, it's
Not fair, you still deny it (so I'll say)
Nothing can fill this silence
No one can love like I did (you don't know, so I'll say)
Nobody cares, you lied, it's
Not fair, you still deny it (so I'll say)

Girl, I hope you understand I
Wanted to hold your hand, but I can't
Wanted to be your man back then
And too bad I know I can't wake up
Because I've lost my weight, and you don't give a fuck about me
This could be a dream, I can't see the things that you see, so please, oh

Girl, I hope you understand I
Wanted to hold your hand, but I can't
Wanted to be your man back then
And you had known and played along, you
Were my home, I wrote you songs
Now you're dead to me, effectively
Removed yourself outside my dreams...




# Let Me Down

Baby, let's pack our bags and head to wherever
Toss these plans out straight through the door
Won't you take my hand? It won't be forever
I don't have to be the one you're looking for
But I broke my foot, got lost on the mountain
Fucked my life again but I'm sure
That you're not too far behind, so I'm counting
On you to stay when my heart is sore

Oh hey, ayy, I think I lost my way
Can you put me back in place?

I know you'd never let me down
But will you lift me off the ground?
Do you even know my name?
And even when I'm safe and sound
It could always turn around
But can you remember my face?

Da-da-da, da-da-da, da-da-da-da
Da-da-da, da-da-da, da-da
Da-da-da, da-da-da, da-da-da-da
Da-da-da, da-da-da, da-da

I know you're depressed
And I know that you're stressed
And I know that you lie to all your friends
I know that you cry and I know that you fight
And I know that you tried, but it won't end
So how would it feel if I were to steal
Your heart away along with this pain?
'Cause you give me butterflies, and I
I need you to stay

I know what you're thinking
You don't wanna say so
Think I'm catching feelings
I don't wanna say no
I like the way your socks look
You should know I hate to
Fall for someone new
But I like to think about you

I know you'd never let me down
But will you lift me off the ground?
Do you even know my name?
And even when I'm safe and sound
It could always turn around
But can you remember my face?

Da-da-da, da-da-da, da-da-da-da
Da-da-da, da-da-da, da-da
Da-da-da, da-da-da, da-da-da-da
Da-da-da, da-da-da, da-da...




# Prairies (feat. mxmtoon)

Alright, final take

Uh-oh, what have you done?
Lock me up, I've fallen in love
Get me out of here, I said get me out of here
And I have homework and shit I need to do
Late assignments and papers overdue
I'm all out of tears, blurry nights won't disappear

I was in my bed, I tried to sleep
I held my breath, I was too weak
I fell into your open arms
You'll break my heart, take it too far
But I don't care, this isn't fair
I love the way you do your hair
I love the way you write your name
I love the way...

You're driving me crazy, you're driving me mad
I keep dreaming of prairies and memories that we'll have
My mom calls me lazy, my friends call me sad
Haven't been eating lately, and I haven't been in class

Uh-oh, how original
Girl meets boy, it's so predictable
Get me out of here, get me out of here
You've got shit you say you gotta do
Left me there just to think it through
Facing all my fears, I've waited years and years

I get a feeling every time I go to bed
Are you thinking about me or is it all just in my head?
'Cause I'm fallin' at the speed of light
Can't keep up with the butterflies
Floating 'round, no sign of slowing down

I was in my bed, I tried to sleep
I held my breath, I was too weak
I fell into your open arms
You'll break my heart, take it too far
But I don't care, this isn't fair
I love the way you do your hair
I love the way you write your name
I love the way...

You're driving me crazy, you're driving me mad
I keep dreaming of prairies and memories that we'll have
My mom calls me lazy, my friends call me sad
Haven't been eating lately, and I haven't been in class

I was in my bed, I tried to sleep
I held my breath, I was too weak
I fell into your open arms
You'll break my heart, take it too far
But I don't care, this isn't fair
I love the way you do your hair
I love the way you write your name
I love the way...

You're driving me crazy, you're driving me mad
I keep dreaming of prairies and memories that we'll have
My mom calls me lazy, my friends call me sad
Haven't been eating lately, and I haven't been in class...




# Contigo (feat. Powfu)

Things weren't ever meant to end this way
I know I fucked it up enough, what can I say?
I'm sorry, I can't seem to make you stay
I promise I won't put you through that pain

I wanna be contigo, but you're not in love with me, so
All of this love turns me cold, enough to turn away
Yeah, I wanna be contigo more than I wanna be free
If that's okay, and I don't wanna make you go
But what more is there to chase?

Contigo, what's that really mean, though?
Giving you attention every second buying Cheetos
Kilos, bragging to my mama and el chicos
No, this won't take one night (duh, ayy)

I know it's all my fault for bouncing off the walls
I would say I'm free, then I would miss your calls
Spending dumb amounts and losing count of my "sorry"s
You'd be crying all night, I know

I wanna be contigo, you're not in love with me, so
All of this love turns me cold, enough to turn away
I wanna be contigo more than I wanna be free
If that's okay, and I don't wanna make you go
But what more is there to chase?

Yeah, I'm falling in and out of sleep, I don't seem to see
Sheep, and I don't clean the sheets, I'm falling seamlessly
We don't need to be repeating all our fantasies
I'm falling for the beat, tryna figure how to breathe

But they never taught me how surfing through the clouds
Speak loud enough about being here and now
Never thought that I would ever get to hear the crowd
Ground's hitting now, guess I wasn't ever found

Oh no, you got me stressed out
Looks like I won't be getting rest now
And I'm home, but my head's living in clouds
Never liked my hometown, never got to get loud

And I hope you'll come around soon
I know, you think of me too
There's no need for you to be rude
Wanna be with you

I wanna be contigo, but you're not in love with me so
All of this love turns me cold, enough to turn away
Yeah, I wanna be contigo more than I wanna be free
If that's okay, and I don't wanna make you go
But what more is there to chase?...




# Heat of Ice

I thought there was something wrong with my life
I thought I was hopeless, thinking I'm out of time
And nothing could change it and nobody knew
I thought I was breaking and then I met you

Oh my, you're so fine
Can't write you out my mind
I like it when you lie to me
I love it when you try to be
Wild, bitchy, impolite
Somehow stuck in my sights
I like that you're not nice to me
I love your heart of ice

Your heart of ice

Your heart of i-

You got a heart of ice
I love the way you don't even try
To hide the fact that you were never mine, oh my
I would've never thought
Would've never figured out your lock
But I tried, and you were caught in a lie

But I wanna fall in love, wanna mend my trust
Wanna fuck my life again
Don't wanna fuck up
Fuck with all these walls when they disguised as friends
I'll never recognize the lies I fantasize inside my head
I'll never get upset, I'll just forget, let regret faster in, 'cause

Oh my, you're so fine
Can't write you out my mind
I like it when you lie to me
I love it when you try to be
Wild, bitchy, impolite
Somehow stuck in my sights
I like that you're not nice to me
I love your heart of ice

Your heart of ice

Your heart of i-

I found a part of me
From a place that you don't seem to see
Where I can go to fall asleep again, and
I know there seems to be too many thoughts for this to be
A dream, I said the same thing to my friends

And I finally thought that you would take me out this spot
But no and now I hope to rid these thoughts
But I can't lie, I know you know it hurts my eyes
To see you, I love how you made me cry

Oh my, you're so fine
Can't write you out my mind
I like it when you lie to me
I love it when you try to be
Wild, bitchy, impolite
Somehow stuck in my sights
I like that you're not nice to me
I love your heart of ice

Your heart of ice

Your heart of i-...



# IDGAF (ft. Blackbear)

You were caught in a lie, said it with your eyes
Said to all my homies that you weren't even mine
You didn't think twice, got a heart made of ice
And that shit hit me, did me dirty
I never asked why and I never did cry
I never told another how I felt inside
My demons don't hide when I'm dreaming at night
And I won't mislead you, you'll miss me

'Cause I don't give a fuck about you no more
Give me back my hoodies, or I'm kicking down doors
You weren't even pretty, looking back, and I'm sure
You still miss me, that's so funny
I don't give a fuck about you, you swore
You would never talk about me before
You lied looking filthy in your ugly jean shorts
You still kissed me, now shit's history (yeah)

I don't mind if we speak again
I don't wanna be cool, I don't wanna be friends
Let me have a life, with my homies it was flirty
Filled me up with lies, and you did me so dirty
'Cause I don't give a fuck about you no more
Left me bleeding with my heart on the floor
You were never really mine, I was never really yours
With the demon on my shoulder, I'm just trying to ignore
And I don't give a shit about your fake ass friends
Hollywood Hills, where we play pretend
I don't wanna say I'm sorry, I don't wanna make amends
I will never make a mistake like you again

'Cause I don't give a fuck about you no more
Give me back my hoodies, or I'm kicking down doors
You weren't even pretty, looking back, and I'm sure
You still miss me, that's so funny
I don't give a fuck about you, you swore
You would never talk about me before
You lied looking filthy in your ugly jean shorts
You still kissed me, now shit's history

Regardless you're so heartless
Let my heart into your darkness
Hid the truth behind your harmless pretty face (aww)
And I know you're running out of other options
Leaving Iin your head rent free, a neurotoxin
And I wake up every morning with a smile in my face
Knowing full well you were put up for adoption
Oh shit, yeah, I went there but honestly, I don't care
You never tried to play fair with me
Left me broken with scars, making all these remarks
So now this is the part where I leave

'Cause I don't give a fuck about you no more
Give me back my hoodies, or I'm kicking down doors
You weren't even pretty, looking back, and I'm sure
You still miss me, that's so funny
I don't give a fuck about you, you swore (you swore)
You would never talk about me before (before)
You lied looking filthy in your ugly jean shorts
You still kissed me, now shit's history...




# Scared of the Dark

Don't you tell me you're fine
I can tell when you're lying
Caught you slipping on ice
But your heart is on fire
'Cause I notice your scars
And I know that it's hard
And I hope you don't start
Gettin' all fucking quiet
'Cause we made it so far
I don't wanna restart
Recollecting these sparks
Reconnecting these wires
'Cause I'm scared of the dark
Can we skip to the part
Where you fall in my arms
And you tell me you're tired?

You can tell me you're tired
Last night you looked quite alright
But you seem so formal all the time
'Cause you laugh and smile, but you never cry
So why? Are you tired?
We go where we want to go
And we call whatever we want home
And we wonder why they never leave us on our own

Don't you tell me you're fine
I can tell when you're lying
Caught you slipping on ice
But your heart is on fire
'Cause I notice your scars
And I know that it's hard
And I hope you don't start
Gettin' all fucking quiet
'Cause we made it so far
I don't wanna restart
Recollecting these sparks
Reconnecting these wires
'Cause I'm scared of the dark
Can we skip to the part
Where you fall in my arms
And you tell me you're tired?

You can tell me you're tired

They say you're better off by yourself
But they never understood just how you felt
When the beat dies down and your soul just melts
And you don't have to hold back tears
'Cause after everything I'm here for you
There's nothing you should fear

Don't you tell me you're fine
I can tell when you're lying
Caught you slipping on ice
But your heart is on fire
'Cause I notice your scars
And I know that it's hard
And I hope you don't start
Gettin' all fucking quiet
'Cause we made it so far
I don't wanna restart
Recollecting these sparks
Reconnecting these wires
'Cause I'm scared of the dark
Can we skip to the part
Where you fall in my arms
And you tell me you're tired?

You can tell me you're tired




# Long Drives

Yeah, I can't do these long drives sittin' in the back seat
Thinkin' 'bout that one night when the world caught fire, baby
And your eyes brightened up this dark scene
You told me I would be fine, I called you a liar

We just FaceTime, is this a sign?
I'm fallin' out of your life
I try my hardest not to think about what I just realized
You said I was your light
I think that's just a white lie
Feelin' so rotten inside, thought I died

I kinda wanna go back, I'm missin' the pain of a heartbreak
And life just don't hit the same, I'm havin' migraines
My friends all over the placе with their lives straight
I guess I'm afraid of growin' out of my placе

'Cause I can't do these long drives sittin' in the back seat
Thinkin' 'bout that one night when the world caught fire, baby
And your eyes brightened up this dark scene
You told me I would be fine, I called you a liar

And all I want is to (take you by the sea)
I'll show you sights from above and take you (to my dismal dreams)
I'll see that falling stars will set your (world on fire, baby)
These flames weren't meant for you and me

You're make-believe, why can't you see?
I'll make these roses all turn green
The seven seas and all the ocean tides will fall into my dreams
I'm drowning, oh (woah)
I wish you weren't so far from me (woah)
I wish you weren't so far from me (oh-woah)

'Cause I can't do these long drives sittin' in the back seat
Thinkin' 'bout that one night when the world caught fire, baby
And your eyes brightened up this dark scene
You told me I would be fine, I called you a liar

Yeah, I can't do these long drives sittin' in the back seat
Thinkin' 'bout that one night when the world caught fire, baby
And your eyes brightened up this dark scene
You told me I would be fine, I called you a liar

Hey, I've been thinkin' 'bout you all damn day
And the sun is shinin' on your face
I think I fell for you
I hate the fact that this is the truth
But okay (oh, oh)
I know I might come off as strange
Just swear I'm not, I'm just in pain
Please, don't drive away from me...




# Loafers (prod. Sarcastic Sounds)

I keep my windows open, front doors broken, I lost my keys
I'm passed out on my futon, gave back your DVD's
It's been so long, but you're embedded to my thoughts
And all the songbirds sing sad songs
Oh, how I treated you so wrong?
I stay up all night long

I see you on the TV
You're in my melatonin dreams
I put my health beneath me
But it's frustratin' that we weren't meant to be

I'm wasted on the sofa
Watchin' time fly, wearin' loafers on my feet
Restless, 'cause I'm lost without you
Kinda awkward 'cause we live on the same street

You're in my melatonin dreams
My eyes can't read what's in between
'Cause it's been all just make-believe
And all I see are fantasies
'Cause I've been sippin' on kava tea

Let's just say goodbye to the good times
Once and for all, just let 'em go home
I know they still give you butterflies

I'm stuck in an awful state of mind
Let it be known that I'm a lone soul
Lost from a romantic paradise

I see you on the TV
You're in my melatonin dreams
I put my health beneath me
But it's frustratin' that we weren't meant to be

I'm wasted on the sofa
Watchin' time fly, wearin' loafers on my feet
Restless, 'cause I'm lost without you
Kinda awkward 'cause we live on the same street

You're in my melatonin dreams
My eyes can't read what's in between
'Cause it's been all just make-believe
And all I see are fantasies
'Cause I've been sippin' on kava tea

Close your eyes and dance with me
Je suis rempli de tristesse et je suis troublé
Weren't meant to be
But it's okay, I feel your pain temporarily

Close your eyes and dance with me
Je suis rempli de tristesse et je suis troublé
Weren't meant to be
But it's okay, I feel your pain temporarily

And I thought we could be more than just friends
But I can understand your situation
I felt like you should know, though
Since we're such good friends, I guess
I'll just wait until you feel okay enough
To see me like I see you
But until then, I can just be your guy best friend

I see you on the TV
You're in my melatonin dreams
I put my health beneath me
But it's frustratin' that we weren't meant to be

I'm wasted on the sofa
Watchin' time fly, wearin' loafers on my feet
Restless, 'cause I'm lost without you
Kinda awkward 'cause we live on the same street

you're in my melatonin dreams
(Weren't meant to be)
(But it's okay, I feel your pain temporarily) my eyes can't read what's in between

'cause it's been all just make-believe
(Weren't meant to be) and all I see are fantasies (but it's okay)
(I feel your pain temporarily)...

Hey, I heard you're doing better, never knew you as a quitter
And I'm glad you're doing okay
I don't know if you remember all the times you wrote me letters
And I think you took me out in fifth grade
And I think I told you, no, I said I wanna take it slow
And I also called you gross to your face
But I think everybody knows it was just a funny joke
So do you wanna go on that date?

I've been feeling quite amazing
Flying kites with you, rephrasing
Words from songs that I wrote myself
It ain't good for my health
But I spend nights thinkin' of you
I write you songs when I miss you
I promise I'll be there to help
Though I might need a ride

You keep catchin' my eyes
Even when I'm terrified
Can't get you off of my mind

Oh, I've been feeling faded 'cause I'm fiending on the Hennessy
Tell everyone I made it, though I'm miles from where I want to be
I told my story countless times to all these fucking companies
I used to be a worthless piece of shit, a boy with issues, see
I've changed throughout this year so much, the who I was, you won't believe
Obsessed with being normal, faking cordial actions, fantasies
Of situations playing out so perfect like the movie scenes
I want to take my mask off, but I'm scared because I'll never be enough for me
I think I'm losing grip on sanity

But I've been feeling quite amazing
Flying kites with you, rephrasing
Words from songs that I wrote myself
It ain't good for my health
But I spend nights thinkin' of you
I write you songs when I miss you
I promise I'll be there to help
Though I might need a ride

You keep catchin' my eyes
Even when I'm terrified
Can't get you off of my mind...




# Toxic

All my friends are toxic, all ambitionless
So rude and always negative
I need new friends, but it's not that quick and easy
Oh, I'm drowning, let me breathe

I'm better off all by myself
Though I'm feeling kinda empty without somebody else
Oh, I hear you crying out for help
But you never showed for me when I was ringing your cellphone
Oh, you don't know how it feels to be alone
Baby, oh, I'll make you know, I'll make you know, oh

I'm drowning, let me breathe
I'm drowning, let me breathe
I'm drowning, let me breathe
I'm drowning, let me breathe

But life is immaculate, backing it up a bit
Counting my hours and knocking on wood
Avoiding my opposites, chewin' on chocolate
Had a bit limited time, but I should
Be good for a minute, don't want to admit it
I'm running on seconds, I'm rigid, I'm screwed
Don't know what to do, I'm thinking of you
I'm drinking up bottles and bottles of booze

I'm better off all by myself
Though I'm feeling kinda empty without somebody else
Oh, I hear you crying out for help
But you never showed for me when I was ringing your cellphone
Oh, you don't know how it feels to be alone
Baby, oh, I'll make you know, I'll make you know, oh

I fell into your river
That's where you told me lies
You said that I'd feel better
But this is where good guys die
You took my pride away, but
You cannot take my life
I'll find another way
I'll wonder if you're takin' my life

Don't you see how I...

I'm better off all by myself
Though I'm feeling kinda empty without somebody else
Oh, I hear you crying out for help
But you never showed for me when I was ringing your cellphone
Oh, you don't know how it feels to be alone
Baby, oh, I'll make you know, I'll make you know, oh

I'm better off all by myself
Though I'm feeling kinda empty without somebody else
Oh, I hear you crying out for help
But you never showed for me when I was ringing your cellphone
Oh, you don't know how it feels to be alone
Baby, oh, I'll make you know, I'll make you know, oh....




# letter for my future ex

I hope you're feeling okay
Because I don't know if I could say the same thing
It started when I saw you with your sweatshirt
Sleeves pulled way past your arm length
And I don't wanna play games
Coming home from each other's place
Pretending we don't know each other's name
I know that's not what you want
But I started catching feelings
But I'm just dreaming
My soul can't touch the ceiling
'Cause I know that this won't last forever
My wallpaper's peeling back now
I try to tell you that I blacked out that night
But that was a lie

I wish you didn't feel so happy wrapped up in my arms
Sipping hard not to rectify I was spitting my heart
Put my heart in 2 pieces 'cause I loved you from thе start
Playing music in the car, and looking up to see the stars
'Cause so far I'm rеally proud of you, and I hate to depart
And it's been getting pretty cold
And it's been getting really dark
I wish you all the best, and I hate to see your ford
But I've made up my mind and I don't wanna play guitar

(Hahaha)
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, oh, whoa, ooh

And I can fall in love again without you (Ooh)
I wish that I could say I dont know how to (Ooh)
I'll take away your b***erflies
I'll make you wish you were still mine
I don't want to
But I know I'm about to...




# Bad luck

I got 24 minutes to finish all of my sentences
To be dependent to medicine while I saw you running away
I said okay to myself
It'd be better for health if I turn around and look the other way

But my brain is a silicone mimic of a dome
And I say that I hate you, but I really don't
You fill my head with ideas
Oh, baby, I can't stay away

Ooh, baby, you stole my heart with your jumper
Kangaroos wearing shoes tryna run from the hunters
I don't know how you've been dealing with all of my shit
I hope I get to stay here with you
I'll take you on a trip

Aw, shucks, my luck
I did not realize how much this could suck
I wish that I thought through everything first
'Cause the further you go through, the deeper the cuts
Aw, shucks, my luck
I'm feeling frisky when I see your butt
Got me on life support, feeling your lust
So where do we go now? I think I'm fucked

Yeah, look, I'm low-key into you
Lately, I can't help but think of taking you out (taking you out, yeah)
But there isn't anything I can do
So I guess I'll just keep your name out my mouth (keep your name out my mouth)

Because I'm kinda into you
Lately I can't help but think of anything else (anything else)
But there isn't anything I can do
I wish I could ask you for some help

Ooh, baby, you stole my heart with your jumper
Kangaroos wearing shoes tryna run from the hunters
I don't know how you've been dealing with all of my shit
I hope I get to stay here with you
I'll take you on a trip

Aw, shucks, my luck
I did not realize how much this could suck
I wish that I thought through everything first
'Cause the further you go through, the deeper the cuts
Aw, shucks, my luck
I'm feeling frisky when I see your butt
Got me on life support, feeling your lust
So where do we go now? I think I'm fucked

Yeah, I think I'm fucked

Yeah, I think I'm fucked...




# Kind of Sick of Life

I don't wanna take out loans, I don't wanna be at home
I don't wanna say goodbye and I don't wanna be alone
I just wanna stay inside, I don't know how or where I'd hide
And I don't wanna suicide, but I'm getting sick of life

I wake up every morning feeling like a sack of shit
And it don't matter if it's pouring outside
'Cause I'm so sick of all the fallacies and galaxies I make with all the sticks I find
And words that rhyme, I try to cry, I tried to mind my pessimist
But consciousness is closing in, and my resolve is wearing thin
Impulsiveness is my illness and demons like to listen in
I'm falling through the corridor of all the things that I adore
I open doors and find a corpse, but I ignore it, of course

Yeah, I ignore it of course
Yeah, I ignore it of course

I just wanna spend the night
I just wanna stop the fighting I hear inside my head
I just wanna hold you tight

I just kinda feel uneasy when it approaches evening
There's monsters in my bed and there's no one that can save me
Lately, I've been feeling crazy
Numbers in my head, I'm counting student loans and babies
Maybe I'll be looking 'round for daisies
To put upon my coffin, I'll be buried in shortly

I wake up every morning feeling like a sack of shit
And it don't matter if it's pouring outside
'Cause I'm so sick of all the fallacies and galaxies I make with all the sticks I find
And words that rhyme, I try to cry, I tried to mind my pessimist
But consciousness is closing in, and my resolve is wearing thin
Impulsiveness is my illness and demons like to listen in
I'm falling through the corridor of all the things that I adore
I open doors and find a corpse, but I ignore it, of course

Yeah, I ignore it of course
Yeah, I ignore it of course...




# Bok Choy

Oh, I'm just a lost boy, I'm suffering
I'm stuck with the bok choy and I miss my friends
Where do we go babe? Where is my home?
Oh, I'm just a lost toy, I lost my soul
I said I lost my soul
Does someone know where I go?
Oh, I can feel that I'm close

Oh, I'm just a lost boy, I'm suffering
I'm stuck with the bok choy and I miss my friends
Where do we go babe? Where is my home?
Oh, I'm just a lost toy and I lost my soul
I said I lost my soul
Does someone know where I go?
Oh, I can feel that I'm close...




# Forget Me

Too slow for the left lane, too fast for the right train
I'm still kicking up dust, I've been eating all Friday
Got on my plans, hey, fuck it, man, I'ma have it my way
It's okay 'til I hurt myself, it's a fucked up world of abysmal health
And I don't wanna be without a bit of hate in my belt

All I want is to break your heart
Oh, I thought that I could go
Oh, baby, you can't save me
I belong on the roads you left me on
I write my pains
Oh, baby, you can't save me

You came late, we just cancelled saving
I'll just write my pains
It's the end of the world

How is this possible?
I've been stuck in my head since elementary school
How can this be?
I've got another soul on my feet
I mean exactly what I mean when Simon says they lonely
I watch these numbers as they come and go, but they forget me

Yeah
Yeah, they forget me
Yeah
So I stay lonely
Yeah
Yeah, they forget me
Yeah
They still don't know me
They still don't know me

All I want is to break your heart
Oh, I thought that I could go
Oh, baby, you can't save me
I belong on the roads you left me on
I write my pains
Oh, baby, you can't save me

Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah...




# Haha, Hi

I think we talked about a TV show that you liked
Something I forget 'cause I was thinking, "Whoa, are her eyes real?"
Ain't no way she gon' be feeling what I feel
But I guess I'm not a psychic, 'cause she's sitting in my automobile right now
Singing as I stir my wheel, oh dear
Like how? It's been well over a year
I don't believe it when she says she misses me or when she kisses me
There must be an alternative motive I miss
So help me, please, to understand
How and why you stuck around
It's like you hopped the fence and said nobody is allowed back here
I disregarded all of my fears
And I remember when we first spoke words, I'll say, "I'm here"

One, two, one, two, three, four

Haha, hi, you've been on my mind
I feel quite alright
When I've got sights from your pretty eyes
I can't find out if you like the sound of my voice
It's a little squeaky, I try to make it sound deeper for you, my baby
Haha, hi, you've been on my mind
I feel quite alright
When I can see your face in the light
I can't find out if you like the sound of my voice
It's a little squeaky, I try to make it sound deeper for you, my baby

My baby (ooh, ooh)
My baby (ooh, ooh)
My baby

I don't appreciate the foliage that blocks being in love with you
Falling on each other, we catch L's but mostly W's
Worry 'bout the lack of time, another time forget to rhyme
Forget about them ends in lines and focus on our aptitude
The poly rhythmic notes upon a measure, we're the only two
Lines in a stanza that don't rhyme, but we somehow do
Winter comes and takes away the sun, but I'll follow through
Drawing inspiration from Romeo Montague
I lose my brain cells when I'm with you
I fell through the fucking room
When I saw you walking through the hallway zone
Can't breathe in this altitude
I'm left with my screws unloose
And you make me feel so good, my baby

Haha, hi, you've been on my mind
I feel quite alright
When I've got sights from your pretty eyes
I can't find out if you like the sound of my voice
It's a little squeaky, I try to make it sound deeper for you, my baby
Haha, hi, you've been on my mind
I feel quite alright
When I can see your face in the light
I can't find out if you like the sound of my voice
It's a little squeaky, I try to make it sound deeper for you, my baby...




# Shy

Hi, hello
I'm quite a shy fellow
Yo no recuerdo palabras cuando estoy contigo
And I still don't know how to let go
Of feelings that I felt for you, baby

And my anxiety's pushing limits
Setting benchmarks higher than the fucking moon
Sorry, I don't mean to be rude
And I've been fighting feelings
'Cause I know that I'm too shy to make a move
Looking up tutorials on YouTube

Stay inside
I'll be home by the morning
Run, don't hide
And stay asleep in your bed because it's pouring

My mind I find to be my decline, I'm fine
Don't ask me how I spend my free time, yeah
Don't ask me why, don't ask me

Hi, hello
I'm quite a shy fellow
Yo no recuerdo palabras cuando estoy contigo
And I still don't know how to let go
Of feelings that I felt for you, baby

And my anxiety's pushing limits
Setting benchmarks higher than the fucking moon
Sorry, I don't mean to be rude

Sometimes I cry
Kinda like a bit of every other line
My insides are reclined 'cause sometimes I feel I rewind
Way too far
I played with cars when I was younger
Now I'm driving down the street to see my friends turn to cigars

And I've been fighting feelings
'Cause I know that I'm too shy to make a move
Looking up tutorials on YouTube...




# Hazel Eyes

Can't get you out of my gaze, and
Can't feel my legs when you're around
I feel so lost, I feel so found
You're poison to my thoughts, but
You look amazing in your gown
I'm feeling great, I'm feeling down

Wishing I could see how you could end up in my arms
I know that you're not perfect for me, but you've caught my heart
I'll sail the seas, sing the ABC's in the war to win you over
I swear you had me right from the start

Let's build a fort out of pillows while we look at the stars
I'll bring a portable charger and we'll dance in the dark
Am I insane for thinking forward to a time so far?
It makes me feel so tired, it makes me rhyme so hard

I see your lovely eyes
They're hazel colored, cloudy like the sky
My, oh, my
I think I might die
I see through tired eyes
Your laugh makes me feel baffled
I'm your guy
But I don't mind, oh

Can't get you out of my gaze, and
Can't feel my legs when you're around
I feel so lost, I feel so found
You're poison to my thoughts, but
You look amazing in your gown
I'm feeling great, I'm feeling down

And I don't think if we go home now
We'll be safe and sound, I don't feel profound
'Cause it's four in the morning, I can feel the forest
Stuck in a cave, we fell without a warning

Am I just going insane?
I swear we've done this before
I can't choose, relieve this pain
But I keep searching for more

I see your lovely eyes
They're hazel colored, cloudy like the sky
My, oh, my
I think I might die
I see through tired eyes
Your laugh makes me feel baffled
I'm your guy
But I don't mind, oh

Yeah, your lovely eyes
Yeah, I don't mind
It's your hazel eyes...




# Two Moons

Two moons, I can feel myself start catching on fire
But you knew, yeah, you kept it to yourself, to yourself
Two moons, I get lost on my way searching for liars
This ain't good for my health, no, this ain't good for my health

Sorry, please excuse me for my mess
My heart's been pouring through my chest
I fell through corridors of broken floors
I'm sorry that I left
Fell asleep in my new bed
I can't feel happy in my head
I see two moons and nothing more
I close my door, I'm left with less

I don't feel serene (no)
No, I don't feel too clean (oh)
And I don't want to be the one to make you cry
I'll play inside, I'll start a fire
I'll tell your friends that I lost my mind
It'll take a while but I'll start to smile
Broken windows and broken tiles
Frozen willows, we'll go for miles
Hope will let go, yeah, that's its style
And you don't know where my soul's headed
I'm forgetting you, so I'll say

Sorry, please excuse me for my mess
My heart's been pouring through my chest
I fell through corridors of broken floors
I'm sorry that I left
Fell asleep in my new bed
I can't feel happy in my head
I see two moons and nothing more
I close my door, I'm left with less

Left, right, my eyesight is diminishing
My life sucks at night, I try to finish it
Early, pearly, whites get blurry
Surely I'll go bite the dirty dust
Cuts deeper as my head goes nuts
I'll be a believer if I ever see trust
I must be disgusting rust
God, I hate myself, I just wanna unplug
Yeah, fuck no
I go where I want to
But I'm stuck in my bedroom
I'm telling lies to keep myself from hurting those around you
Yeah, after all these years I found you
I found you again

Sorry, please excuse me for my mess
My heart's been pouring through my chest
I fell through corridors of broken floors
I'm sorry that I left
Fell asleep in my new bed
I can't feel happy in my head
I see two moons and nothing more
I close my door, I'm left with less...




# Psycho

Tobi tells me lies when I'm sleep-deprived
Tobi says that I'm the worst of my kind
The voice that trails behind makes me petrified
Thinking I won't live to see twenty-five

They tell me I should go, go, go, go
They say I have no home, no home
They tell me I should go, go, go, go
They tell me I'm a psycho, psycho

(Sweatshirt's dirty, my friends hurt me
My girlfriend is flirting with another dude
Tobi tells me that he doesn't like her attitude)

Through all this plain, I fear my health
Are you insane? Why are you calling for help?
After all this time we've spent together
You really gotta leave me cooped up all to myself
With all this pain and suffering
I let the raindrops hit my friends
Excuse myself in the kitchen table
I don't have a clue of what you want me to do

They tell me I should go, go, go, go
They say I have no home, no home
They tell me I should go, go, go, go
They tell me I'm a psycho, psycho...




# Out of Tune

No matter what I do
I can't love because of you
You fucked me up and put me out of tune
I do my best to fake that I'm good
But I forget my place too soon
Oh, can't you say goodbye
To the scars you left behind?
How 'bout you get the fuck outta my mind?
I swear that I can't feel love
Oh, won't you say goodbye
To all my butterflies?
I can't look you in your eyes again

I began to track dark times with no peach
Lime smoothies, no time for bus rides with
Sad rhymes to climb right out of dark times
I pass the clock by watching you playing Fortnite
No, for real, that's what got me through this whole ordeal
Stuck out of tune, I made it through by watching Key & Peele
Stuck in my bed while my heart is turned to steel
Got no covers or no blankets 'cause I know that love ain't, no, real

No matter what I do
I can't love because of you
You fucked me up and put me out of tune
I do my best to fake that I'm good
But I forget my place too soon
Oh, can't you say goodbye
To the scars you left behind?
How 'bout you get the fuck outta my mind?
I swear that I can't feel love
Oh, won't you say goodbye
To all my butterflies?
I can't look you in your eyes again

One day I thought back
When I lacked a lot of stuff that I have
I cracked the moments that I kept to my back
Go back to snowmen that I built in winter times in Minecraft
The beat goes up down, I'm thinkin' about the times that I had
And I was hurt pretty bad, now that I think to myself
It makes the happy inside and the fifty thousand bookshelves
But looking back I'm not mad at all of the shit that I sat through
Yeah, that's true, I bet you I was willing to roam the backrooms for you

No matter what I do
I can't love because of you
You fucked me up and put me out of tune
I do my best to fake that I'm good
But I forget my place too soon
Oh, can't you say goodbye
To the scars you left behind?
How 'bout you get the fuck outta my mind?
I swear that I can't feel love
Oh, won't you say goodbye
To all my butterflies?
I can't look you in your eyes again...




# Sleep Deprived

Is it wrong that I still like you, baby?
Is it wrong that I write you songs?
Am I wrong for holding on to my feelings?
That I've felt for, oh, so long

Maybe I should go to sleep
Been thinking that I might be over my head in too deep
I'm having fever dreams in my bed while I count my sheep
I become deprived of my sleep and mental health is weak
I think, I think

It gets tough when I see your face light up
Like a candle when you look in his eyes
I hope that you could see my silence
Pray for God I stay in disguise

So maybe I should go to sleep
Been thinking that I might be over my head in to deep
I'm having fever dreams in my bed while I count my sheep
I become deprived of my sleep and mental health is weak
I think, I think...




# Head Song

# i don’t like parties anymore

(Ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh)

I don't know where'd you go
Take me home, I'm alone
I hope you are not cold
I'm alone

Where'd you go? Where'd you go? (Ooh)
Where'd you go? Where'd you go? (Ooh)
Take me home, take me home (Ooh)
Take me home, take me home (Ooh)

(Ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh)

I'll just let go when I'm feeling low
I just wanna blow out this water
I'll go when I hear the crows
It's so close, it gets harder to see
I feel cold with the breeze
Yo no sé por qué también estoy cansado
Más claras fueron las palabras dе sus labios
Tengo un poco de fuego
Tе lo dije, hasta luego

(Ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh)...




# Animal Crackers

I have Animal Crackers
And the birthday cake that I bought from Walmart
Got all of my lanterns to turn green
And I'll wait until sunset
For you to open, your invitations
I don't want you to think I'm a creep

Please, don't run away from me
I got chicken wings fried in canola oil to bring
I close my eyes, so I won't feel the hurt, I won't see
I bite my tongue, I hope that you would come, I can't breathe

And when I thought that I could try and send out invitations
I realized that nobody likes me, party's in the basement
I still have lots of cake left over, I don't wanna say it
But I'm complacent, I will stay and I will make the payments so

Please don't run away from me
I got chicken wings fried in canola oil to bring
I close my eyes, so I won't feel the hurt, I won't see
I bite my tongue, I hope that you would come, I can't breathe

La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la

Please don't run away from me
I got chicken wings fried in canola oil to bring
I close my eyes, so I won't feel the hurt, I won't see
I bite my tongue, I hope that you would come, I can't breathe...




# Tired of wanting you

I'm not sad, I'm not tired
But I feel I'm bad
I feel different from others
I wish I had what they have
But I'm just dreaming of randomness scheming
I got empty feelings
I wrestle my demons at night

I'm not sad
I'm just tired of wanting you
I want to say I think you're cute
But I can't say it now because
That's not my character
Maybe in another universe

I just think that it's funny
That I cannot bring
Myself from my conscience
To rid of my butterfly things
I don't feel right when I'm not with you
I'll keep you insight
But I won't pursue

I'm not sad
I'm just tired of wanting you
I want to say I think you're cute
But I can't say it now because
If I do, I'll never sleep if you say no to me
But you'll probably

I'm not sad
I'm just tired of wanting you
I want to say I think you're cute
But I can't say it now because
That's not my character
Maybe in another universe...




# Route 9

Funny that I fall apart
When I streamline route 9 with my car, I scream
Insomnia won't keep me up
But when morning comes I'm almost out of steam

I hold on to all my vices while my head is in a crisis
I hurt my feet, and I dot my T's
And I clean my room like twice a year
When I'm breaking down
I'm a sex machine in my dreams

Oh, please, don't ever leave
I said please, don't ever leave
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

Please, don't ever leave
I said please, don't ever leave

I drive by Lincoln Avenue
When I feel down just to look at you, I know
That it's strange
And when the light comes shining through the sky
I felt it coursing through my veins
I switch lanes
I don't listen to the voices in my head
I'm going Mach 1 on route 9
And I cleaned my room for the second time
This year, you asked me how I was, "I'm fine", I lied

Oh, please, don't ever leave
I said please, don't ever leave

Funny that I fall apart (please don't)
When I streamline route 9 with my car, I scream (ever leave)
Insomnia won't keep me up (please don't)
But when morning comes I'm almost out of steam (ever leave)
I hold on to all my vices while my head is in a crisis (please, don't ever)
I hurt my feet, and I dot my T's (leave)
And I clean my room like twice a year (please don't)
When I'm breaking down (ever)
I'm a sex machine, in my dreams (leave)...




# Lost

(It's not stained, well, it looks stain
What's with all the clothes on the ground
Don't you have like a, don't you have drawers?
Jesus, how much clothes do you have?)

I'm lost, I'm launched and displaced
A disgrace shot out of orbit floating into outer space
I'm amazed, I guess it's me who won the race
I'm left with 18 years of life, I still don't know my name
Notice that I walk with inhibition feeling upside down
It's blurry in my visions, are you happy?
You don't gotta lie and try to say, that you're my safest sound
You'd hurry up to find out, I'm unhappy
I just wanna be around

Why do I deserve to die?
Doesn't everybody lie once in a while?
Why do I try to stay alive?
Why am I unorganized?
I despise the lies that keeps me tied until I reach my time
Pain hurts, yeah
Pain hurts, pain hurts
Though I try to be patient
And I know that I'm slow
I'll be open for a new interpretation
Ah, I know I've been messing around for too long
But I guess I'm too dumb to say that I'm wrong
I'm a little young to think that I'm strong
I belong to who? I hope it's not long

I'm falling down
(I'm falling, falling to you)

I'm lost
I'm launched and displaced
A disgrace shot out of orbit, floating into outer space
I'm amazed, I guess it's me who won the race
I'm left with 18 years of life, I still don't know my name
Notice that I walk with inhibition feeling upside down
It's blurry in my visions, are you happy?
You don't gotta lie and try to say that you're my safest sound
You'd hurry up to find out I'm unhappy
I just wanna be around...




# Blurry Nights

You said that you love me
But you told a lie
Outside you're lovely
But I've seen inside
And all of your friends told me
Time wasn't right

You go too slow
You stay so cold
I speak my mind
You still say no

It's blurry nights that haunt my mind
Don't wanna find out, might just cry
I might have tied myself up high
And just let go, I'll touch the sky for you
It's blurry nights I can't get through
You told me lies I thought were true
But, I'll get over you

Two things on my birthday
I don't want a cake, give me a Sunday
Where I don't think of getting hanged
I don't wanna play just give me one day
Where I don't think of getting played
I'm a sensitive guy with no touché
I done fucked up, on my plate
I got plenty of problems, and it's too late

It's blurry nights that haunt my mind
Don't wanna find out, might just cry
I might have tied myself up high
And just let go, I'll touch the sky for you
It's blurry nights I can't get through
You told me lies I thought were true
But, I'll get over you

You go too slow
You stay so cold
I speak my mind
You still say no

It's blurry nights that haunt my mind
Don't wanna find out, might just cry
I might have tied myself up high
And just let go, I'll touch the sky for you
It's blurry nights I can't get through
You told me lies I thought were true
But, I'll get over you...




# Zoning Out

One, two, three, four

I recall a time, all I did was sit and swim
I was lost in my head and I wouldn't let you in
But we were never hungry, and never in despair
And I was always nice 'til I dragged you up the stairs by your hair

I'm zoning out
I'm zoning out
Woah, yeah
I'm zoning
One, two, three, four

I don't wanna talk about it
I got plenty of reasons to be in awe off topic
But I've been on the road for far too long (far too long)
I don't remember much, let's keep it that way
Keep it outta touch for me
I've been a mess for far too long (far too long)

And I feel like that I can try to be the guy that you like
But I don't know why I feel cold and feel the need to be liked
Oh, my soulless mind, emotionless psychosis, I'm below it
I'm ferociously impotent, underneath the streetlight, oh

Mom and dad would argue
No, dad would yell at mom
And I could hear mom crying
Every night for about a month
But I hear this is normal
I hear from my own head
No, dad was always nice
Except when he wished us all dead

I'm zoning out
I'm zoning out
Woah, yeah
I'm zoning
One, two, three, four

I don't wanna talk about it
14 letters, wish I never heard it
But I've been on the road for far too long (far too long)
I don't remember much, let's keep it that way
Keep it outta touch for me
I've been a mess for far too long (far too long)

And I feel like that I can try to be the guy that you like
But I don't know why I feel cold and feel the need to be liked
Oh, my soulless mind, emotionless psychosis, I'm below it
I'm ferociously impotent, underneath the streetlight, oh...




# 2.9 Miles Away

I don't wanna go alone into my bed
Can you let me use your shoulder for my head
And you don't have to be outside
'Cause I don't mind
I got room, and I got time for you
Instead of being so cold

You could stay
And we could binge watch movies night and day
I don't want you to be 2.9 miles away
(Aww)

Whenever I see you I feel like
Another deer or a caribou caught in headlights
Losing my focus on my own but it's alright
'Cause I can see us dancing in the moonlight
Oh, I get so cold without you
About to let you know that
I just renewed my subscription of Hulu

And baby, you could stay
And we could binge watch movies night and day
I don't want you to be 2.9 miles away
(Aww)...




# I wish

I wish I was in your class
I only see you in the halls
I wish I could hold your hand and pull you close
But we don't even talk at all
At all
At all
At all

I don't wanna be that guy
I'm kind of shy
I mean, I don't feel like just saying "Hi"
And I don't wanna be alone
I just wanna be at home
Next to you with my tunes

I wish I could call you, baby
But I don't think it's happening now
Feeling like a lost cause since the beginning
And it just don't want to be found
I don't wanna try too hard to be different
And I don't wanna be too loud
Oh, baby, I won't make a sound

I wonder if we'll ever meet, I hope I see you again
I hope you're healthy so I get to see you laugh with your friends
Ever since my favorite letters have been "Y, R, U, A, Q, T"
TV Documentaries can make a series talking 'bout your beauty
I think of Paris when I'm thinking of a future, it's true
I know it's weird 'cause you don't know me
And I still don't know you
In my dreams we're having birthday parties with presents I love
But I wish I could have you I, R, L
But I'm not enough

I wish I could call you, baby
But I don't think it's happening now
Feeling like a lost 'cause since the beginning
And it just don't want to be found
I don't wanna try too hard to be different
And I don't wanna be too loud
Oh, baby, I won't make a sound

I wish I could call you, baby
But I don't think it's happening now
Feeling like a lost 'cause since the beginning
And it just don't want to be found
I don't wanna try too hard to be different
And I don't wanna be too loud
Oh, baby, I won't make a sound...




# I won’t let you go

Where do we go in the middle of June?
Night is over, I mean, what can I do?
These days I'm fallin'
These days I'm fallin' over you
Where do we go in the middle of June?

Woah, I won't let you go
No, no, no, no, no (I said)
Woah, I won't let you go, go, go

We'll be sipping lemonade, we'll be fine
Don't worry about the time
We're falling outta place, but I don't mind

Feeling real cold in the midst of July
'Cause you're not by my side
I been a mess, but I don't think you're mine

Eyes wide, don't hide
My mind can't find what's making you go home
Baby, use your feelings, woah-oh-oh
Low tides upsides
My pride has died
I tried to let you go
Baby, what's your reason?

These days, I'm fallin'
These days, I'm fallin' over you
Where do we go in the middle of June?

We'll be sipping lemonade, we'll be fine
Don't worry about the time
We're falling outta place, but I don't mind

Feeling really cold in the midst of July
'Cause you're not by my side
I been a mess, but I don't think you're mine...




# Lovely

We kissed under the stars so far away
We could see Mars
I felt like maybe it was now I had a purpose
You held me close, said it was cold
I said I know, I told you I was nervous
And you will always be
So flawed and imperfect
But I can only see your eyes

Lovely like a fire in the sky, I don't care
Your eyes are like a jar of fireflies, summer air
I'd like to hold your hand while I see you smile
Lovely that I get to hold it for a while

Lovely like a fire in the sky, I don't care
Your eyes are like a jar of fireflies, summer air
I'd like to hold your hand while I see you smile
Lovely that I get to hold it for a while

It was so cold, gave you my coat
You looked at me like I was such a cretin
And I was, but I don't regret it
Yeah, I cannot stress it enough
So cold, yeah, it was so cold
I think that's why I always feel cold
So cold, yeah, it was so cold
I guess that's why my songs say I'm cold

Lovely like a fire in the sky, I don't care
Your eyes are like a jar of fireflies, summer air
I'd like to hold your hand while I see you smile
Lovely that I get to hold it for a while

Lovely like a fire in the sky, I don't care
Your eyes are like a jar of fireflies, summer air
I'd like to hold your hand while I see you smile
Lovely that I get to hold it for a while

52 weeks, lovely, can't believe you're with me
We're pretty good at this, lasted 'til near Christmas
Fortunately, I still think you're

Lovely like a fire in the sky, I don't care
Your eyes are like a jar of fireflies, summer air
I'd like to hold your hand while I see you smile
Lovely that I get to hold it for a while

Lovely like a fire in the sky, I don't care
Your eyes are like a jar of fireflies, summer air
I'd like to hold your hand while I see you smile
Lovely that I get to hold it for a while

Lovely like a fire in the sky, I don't care
Your eyes are like a jar of fireflies, summer air
I'd like to hold your hand while I see you smile
Lovely that I get to hold it for a while...




# Letter for my bed

Sorry, please excuse me for the mess
I promise it's a temporary issue
I'm tired let me lay down on your chest
We can go to CVS together looking for some tissues
I just wanna wake up every morning and just fall back asleep
I'm on a phone call with Roald Dahl, we're friends in my dream
I get the sore jaw treatment from when I grit my teeth
I feel my stress overwhelming me until I'm deadbeat, no

I can't say no
I can't say no to you
I can't say no
I can't say no, it's true

When I feel like a pain, like a burden, go
Take another day 'cause it's hurtin', oh
I feel you close to me (Melatonin upping the dose, it's not killing us)
(Melatonin upping the dose, it's not killing us)
Because no matter where we go, circumnavigate the globe
Space probes UFOs' will keep us, company
(Melatonin upping the dose, it's not killing us)
(Melatonin upping the dose, it's not killing us)

I can't say no
I can't say no to you
I can't say no
I can't say no, it's true
I can't say no
I can't say no to you
(Melatonin upping the dose, it's not killing us)
(Melatonin upping the dose, it's not killing us)
I can't say no
I can't say no, it's true
(Melatonin upping the dose, it's not killing us)
(Melatonin upping the dose, it's not killing us)...




# Just Let Me Go

Baby, I don't want to say
I want you to be okay
My ceiling's coming down to play with my head
Oh, but they can't get me in my bed (Aww)
Where do I go when it gets cold?
Colder than the moon
They wanna live before they get old
But I'm not sure I want to

Oh-oh no, oh-oh no, oh-oh no, oh-oh-oh no
Oh-oh no, oh-oh no, oh-oh no, oh-oh-oh no

I just wanna feel like I'm okay
I just wanna go, I got one foot in the grave
I just wanna go, I know my place
Please just let me go
Living like a fool, it's not a race

See that I'm psycho, I feel like I might go
While birds running circles go numb
I hate when I stuck home, I hate when I'm alone
I can't wait, my demons have won
See that I'm psycho, I feel like I might go (I just wanna go)
While birds running circles go numb (I know my place)
I hate when I stuck home, I hate when I'm alone (Please, just let me go, living like a fool it's not a race)
I can't wait, my demons have won

I'm a safer driver with a phone in one hand
Could you help my mom when I'm gone? 'Cause I can't
I'll see you soon, or not, I'll set you free...




# So cold

Lately my ambitions don't
Faze me, birthday wishes, oh
Maybe we go fishing on Sunday, some day
Baby, you're omnipotent, like, daily I'm always open to
Waste me, waste myself, disillusioned
Don't give a fuck 'bout health

I'm by the fireworks, they set up at the pond
I see your tires work, I hiccup when you're gone
I get admirers, I set up with the con
I'm a retired clerk, I'm fed up with the song

I feel unhappy right now, when it's you getting lied to
I say to you now, I get gaslighted
I'm so like unhappy now, I don't know how to count
All my blessings of you, babe, I don't know
When I'm with you

I would rather choose a dare than a truth, that's what I'd do
You have no proof of what I could do
Would you like to run a mile with my shoes
Yeah, with my shoes, in my shoes

Why do I feel cold? Why do I feel cold?
When I'm underneath the sun
Why do I feel cold? Why do I feel cold?
When I'm underneath the sun
Why do I feel cold? Why do I feel cold?
When I'm underneath the sun...




# Galaxy

I wonder why
I feel I'm on top of the moon
Oh wait it's cuz of you
I fill my cup with apple juice
Sunday morning watching cartoons
Baby I don't wanna go home tonight
Let me stay with you
It's 4 am, and your dads come in

'Cause I don't get spooked easily
Looked on tv, I swear I saw your eyes
I was watching documentaries
Of stars and Mars and planets in the sky

Have you ever wondered like I do?
And had those sleepless nights
It's when I think of you
Have you ever wondered like I do?
Wish I could fly my kite
And wake up next to you

'Cause I don't get spooked easily
Looked on tv, I swеar I saw your eyes
I was watching documentariеs
Of stars and Mars and planets in the sky

'Cause I don't get spooked easily (I'll always here for you)
Looked on tv, I swear I saw your eyes (I'll never lie to you)
I was watching documentaries (You'll always be)
Of stars and Mars and planets in the sky (My galaxy, galaxy)...




# Nihilist

I live in the future in my head
Wish I wasn't alone in my bed
This is just the way it is
Yeah this is just the way it is
In my bedroom, I like it cold
Got no schedule, I might say no
My watch tells time that's two months early
Surely, I got nowhere to go

Woahhh
I don't want to go
Pull me back to now
Take away what I've got
So I don't lose my crown

Woahhh
I don't want to go
Pull me back to now
Take away what I've got
So I don't lose my crown

These days I feel like I got more than I asked for
And more
I got reports to go door to door
To store thoughts beneath the floorboards
And I could care less if worlds at war
I'd care more if I lived in the present
Wasn't trying to flеx it
But I'm out like the Brexit
I want bagеls and cream cheese
Pizza and breadsticks
I just turned 18
And I'm nihilistic...




# Where do we go (uke)

Where do we go?
In the middle of june
Nights lights are over I mean
What can I do?
These days I'm falling
Yeah these days I'm
Falling on you

(woah-oh)
(oh)
(woah-oh)
Falling on you
What do we mean?
When we wanna go far
Where do I go I just need
A car I think I'm falling
I think I'm falling on..

Where do we go?
When it gets cold
Colder than the moon
Oh I wanna live
Before I get old

So I try to
From nine to five
I have no life
My lips are dry
Like my melodies

I close my eyes
I cut closе ties
I can't keep up
Oh just set me free

From ninе to five
I have no life
My lips are dry
Like my melodies
I close my eyes
I cut close ties
I can't keep up
Oh just set me free

(WOAH-OH-OH-OH)

(WOAH-OH-OH-OH)

(WOAH-OHHHH)

(WOAH-OH-OH-OH-OH)

(WOAH-OHHHH-WOAH-OH-OH)...




# Fifteen hours (uke)

I got fifteen hours
No mind, no flowers from here
And I got sixteen dollars
No collars, no champagne or beer
But it don't matter
'Cause I got plenty more days
To be ways to be tired
Frankly, I'll be amazed to see my mind rewired
No, I cannot find it again

I know there's no need to be
In the state of mind that I'm in
But my woah's are a centerpiece
In a testament to the end, of my slumber
Oh, how the numbers are passin' through in my head
Oh, how the numbers, they don't end

(I know there's no need to be)
(In the statе of mind that I'm in)
(But my woah's are a centerpiеce)
(In a testament to the end, of my slumber)
(Oh, how the numbers are passin' throughin my head)
(Oh, how the numbers, they don't end)...




# Have you ever wonder like I do

I like to think that I know what to do
With the thoughts
I think I'm talkin' way past two
When I blink I'm thinkin' about you
But you got few oh's
And you got no clue
I get the feeling that as time goes by
I can fly because you're here in mind
Keep the thoughts inside
That I just won't keep
Can't enjoy our times
'Cause my heads hardwired to blink
And some nights I can't even think
I can't even sleep 'til ten past three
Thinkin' who would I take?
And where would I be?
And who would I talk to?
Talkin' to me can't and I won't do
When can I see?
Promise this is not what it seems
This is not a sad song

Have you ever wonderd like I do?
And had those sleepless nights
It's when I think of you
Have you ever wonderd like I do?
Wish I could fly my kite and
Wake up next to you
Have you ever wonderd like I do?
And had those sleepless nights
It's when I think of you
Have you ever wonderd like I do?
Wish I could fly my kite and
Wake up next to you

My time alone is me on the phone
Home grown loan
Diggers diggin' tombs with the tone
One, two, three
Triggers makin' phones and my loans
Nexum rome got
No space to roam
No space to clone
No space to grow
No space to grow
No space to grow

Have you ever wonderd like I do?
And had those sleepless nights
It's when I think of you
Have you ever wonderd like I do?
Wish I could fly my kite and
Wake up next to you
Have you ever wonderd like I do?
And had those sleepless nights
It's when I think of you
Have you ever wonderd like I do?
Wish I could fly my kite and
Wake up next to you...




# I dunno

I, thought maybe if I took the lead
Thought maybe if I stopped to breath
By myself
I'd get there someday
Why, should anybody follow me?
All I wanted is some company
From my home
I'll get it one day

All I gotta do is fall
Yeah, all I gotta do is fall
Down low
Tonight

I don't know who I'd go to
When I feel down and frown (Woah)
These days feel so unhopeful
I hope I just don't drown (Woah)
I don't know who I'd go to
When I feel down and frown (Woah)
These days feel so unhopeful
I hope I just don't drown (Woah)




# Sleep paralysis

It's 3 A.M
I can't see anything
Are my eyes opening?
'Cause I see a demon now
Can't get the feelings in my arm back
I wanna go back, oh, to sleep
I can't move, I can't breathe
Awake right now
I can see why people still wet their beds
How, I run
I can't feel, I'm fucking scared to death right now
Maybe I should try to open my eyes

Man, fuck this
I hate sleep paralysis
It scares the shit out of me everytime
I mean, fuck this
I hate sleep paralysis
I hate it so much that I made it a rhyme

I start rapping 'cause I'm feeling redacted
And I'm being attacked in another fucking dimension
I got my house, my mansion
Get the hell out my mentions
Attention to detail, the female savage
She sells seashells by the seashore
But he sells hair gel by the third floor
And no more stores report down the core
The door looks nice and so does the floor...




# Wow je suis tellement créatif

Listen closely
I'm gonna ask you once
I made this mostly
Because I'm bored as fuck
So listen closely
I'm gonna ask you once
Can you tell me
How softball was?

'Cause I care about how your day went
And I want you to study your French
So you can keep your ninety somethin'
In my class

I hope you're not cringing as bad as I am
Really must suck wake up at 6 A.M
Monday morning, oh God, I'll be in bed
But really, just tell me how your day went...




# Late Nite Snacks

I'm so hungry when it gets late
I'll have a dinner for two
I get the munchies after eight
Wish I could eat food with you
But I sit alone and I wait for the
Microwave and I'm in my home
And It starts to get late
I start to regret how much I ate
Before, because it definitely was not
Enough

I wish I did not eat
So goddamn much
I'm into deep
My metabolic rate just
Cannot keep up
With the speed in which I eat
I eat too much

It's 11:35
And I'm making all my sides
I got french fries ketchup, relish, mayo
On my fried rice can't find anything
To compliment my spice to find
Divine dining and finе without whine
And I can't drink and I know that
If I keep this up and I'll turn fat
It's wack a shack eating out of a crock plot
Oh shit- I mean a crockpot
I got a minutе left
On the microwave
Gotta fill up on my foodies
More than everyday, hey, I just wanna say
Baby Carrots gonna be on my plate

I wish I did not eat
So goddamn much
I'm into deep
My metabolic rate just
Cannot keep up
With the speed in which I eat
I eat too much

(and that is it)...
